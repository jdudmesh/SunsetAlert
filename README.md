# SunsetAlert
This is a work in progress. It will show an alert at local sunset (to remind me to put the chickens to bed). I forked https://github.com/zaferarican/menubarpopoverswiftui2 just to get started. I haven't done any native Swift development for a long time. Much has changed.

The plan is to poll for local sunset based on Lat/Lon in UI hourly and parse the response. An alert with a sound will be shown at sunset. Future improvements could include sunrise times too.
